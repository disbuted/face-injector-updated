# READ ME FIRST
- I will NOT be giving any sort of support with this. If you do not know what to do, I suggest you go take some lessions on c++ and learning drivers as this is kinda needed to drive an injector!
- Secondly, I will link a youtuber for those who are stuck with learning how to make a basic IOCTL Driver. Do not expect this to go anywhere as this will not include any sort of AC bypasses etc, you will need to learn to do so yourself or skid. Its not my problem!!!
# Changelogs
- Made some minor UI changes to make more appealing to those skids who are obsessed with ASCII art and randomised titles.
- Removed some old original malware that was embedded in this with BASE64 Decode and Encoding strings. Tested this myself and its safe.
# Others
- Update drivers [MUST NEED] If not updated, this will show as a multitude of driver errors so UPDATE THE DRIVERS.
- Update the mapping or whatever you would like to do. This is just an example code with the basic amount of changes added mainly for cosmetic appeal.

- Credits to busybox10 for Original.
