# CHANGELOGS
- Made some minor UI changes to make more appealing to those skids who are obsessed with ASCII art and randomised titles.
- Removed some old original malware that was embedded in this with BASE64 Decode and Encoding strings. Tested this myself and its safe.
# Others
- Update drivers [MUST NEED] If not updated, this will show as a multitude of driver errors so UPDATE THE DRIVERS.
- Update the mapping or whatever you would like to do. This is just an example code with the basic amount of changes added mainly for cosmetic appeal.
# Others
- Credits to KANKOSHEV V2.
- Credits to busybox10 for Original.
